        w_description:"These wings have long broad feathers that are spread out integrated wing slots for warm air to rise through (creating \'thermals\') that help the bird rise even higher in the sky. This mechanism of maintaining altitude helps the bird to conserve energy and circle on any prey spotted.",

The flippers are stiff and attached to heavy bones and muscles at the base of the flipper. The feathers on the flippers are scale-like making flippers waterproof. These wings generate a jet-like propulsion when the penguin strokes via the water.",
