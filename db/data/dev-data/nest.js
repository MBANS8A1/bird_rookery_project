If lined with materials there is usually some buck pellets or pebbles lined on the outside of the nest in order to camouflage the nest. Their adult parents have to really protective because these the hatchlings/chicks are vulnerable to predators and can be seen from the air as 'fluff-balls' running around on the groud to vigilant aerial predators.

Sometimes the cavities can be within roofs, buildings or in artificial walls. The cavities in trees usually have trunks facing away from the elements (rain, snow, etc) and end in a chamber where the chicks/eggs are. However, competition for these types of nests are fierce between birds in the same species and between those of different species. ",

Insome cases they can be built of fluffly seeds or sheeps\' wool and matted to be waterproof; in these cases the nest will have a lot of false entrances that lead to shallow pouches (which helps fool predators).The adult birds close the entrance to the nest with their feet when they arrive or leave the nest.",
