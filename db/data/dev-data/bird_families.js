    f_description:"This is a large family that includes the True Owl found on all continents except Antarctica. 95% are forest-dwelling but most are non-migratory with rest migrating depending on the seasons. These owls have large heads, elongated eyes and a short hooked bill that point downwards. Mnay species have ear tufts that are suggested to be for behavioural functions. They have talons that are sharp and hooked and with a reversible fourth toes (zygodactyly). Like most owls they hunt in low-light conditions. When confronted with danger they will crouch down, lower their heads, dropp their wings and ruffle their feathers.",

    f_description:"These are the the aquatic flightless birds that almost exclusively are found on the Southern hemisphere, with only the Galapagos Penguin being north of the equator. These penguins have countershaded white undersides and dark black dorsal plumage. Half of their lives are spent in oceans and the other half is spent on land. FOr the most part they tend to breed in large colonies and form monogamous pairs int he breeding season. Young penguins with grey-white down sometimes assemble in groups to keep warm called crèches. When a mother loses a chick (due to hypothermia, predators etc) they may attempt to steal chicks from other mothers.Overall they tend to be large birds weighing 40kg or more.",

Plumage is mostly white ventrally and brown-black dorsally. THeir wings are long and set far back on their bodies. They have binocular vision due to the way their eyes are set in relation to the bills, with some billes being stout and conical. Their feet are  totilamate(webeed between all four toes). These Sulids breed in mixed colonies with other Sulids or sometimes with frigatebirds and comorants. Gannets are migratory while boobies are more sedentary.",

    f_description:"These family of near-flightless birds are founf in Mexico, Central America and South America. They like hiding and running away to get away from danger rather than flying. Males and females have similar plumage with the females being slightly larger and mostly omnivores. During breeding season females will wander through territories maintained by males and mate with many males laying eggs in nests on the ground that are concealed by rocks and vegetation. These birds are hunted by humans and considered agricultural pests and have been bred in captivity.",
